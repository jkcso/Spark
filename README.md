# Spark

## Who is Who
Spark is an online forum for two types of people: Part time or unemployed developers and non technical people with ideas or mini tech problems.  Developers can get inspired and hone their problem solving skills, understand what is trending and more importantly get iterative feedback from stakeholders.  Non technical people are often missing the expertise and skillset to proceed with their idea or problem.  Often, they don’t have the time or energy to practise and learn new skills so we provide them with the capability of posting in this forum and find one or many interested developers.

## How it operates
The website has 2 main usages:  
* Developers are ideally addressing submitted issues for free or for a bounty reward.  These can be open source and customised to the audience because the final goal is to help the one who submitted the issue in our forum.  Then, and maybe more importantly, they can now get iterative feedback coming from the interested audience towards what they are building.

* Non technical people are ideally those who post such ideas or mini tech issues so that developers can hack a solution.  To do so, they need to provide them with what is needed in terms of information, design and other ideas so that the best possible result can be hopefully produced iteratively.

## Spark vs The Rest
Spark's goal is to *avoid* creating (another) database full of posts that no one pays attention to.  Tries to to bridge this communication gap between the two aforementioned parties via a quick and easy internal, data-driven way to provide iterative feedback to developers and the other way around that is to provide the end user with an easy way to play/demo the app.
